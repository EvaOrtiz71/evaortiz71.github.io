            The movie is set in Narnia, a land of talking animals and 
            mythical creatures that is ruled by the evil White Witch. 
            In the frame story, four English children are relocated to a
            <br> 
            large, old country house following a wartime evacuation. 
            The youngest, Lucy, visits Narnia three times via the magic 
            of a wardrobe in a spare room. Lucy's three siblings are 
            <br>
            with her on her third visit to Narnia. In Narnia, the 
            siblings seem fit to fulfil an old prophecy and find 
            themselves adventuring to save Narnia and their own lives. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The lion Aslan gives his life to save one of the children; 
            he later rises from the dead, vanquishes the White Witch, 
            and crowns the children Kings and Queens of Narnia.

            2004 American epic biblical drama film co-produced and 
            directed by Mel Gibson from a screenplay he wrote with 
            Benedict Fitzgerald. It stars Jim Caviezel as Jesus of 
            Nazareth, 
            <br>
            Maia Morgenstern as the Blessed Virgin Mary, 
            and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene. It depicts the 
            Passion of Jesus largely according to the gospels of 
            Matthew, Mark, Luke, 
            <br>
            and John. It also draws on pious accounts such as the 
            Friday of Sorrows, along with the purported mystical 
            visions attributed to Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich.
