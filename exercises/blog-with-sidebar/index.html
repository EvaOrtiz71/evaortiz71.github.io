                <h2>Worship vs Praise: "What do you prefer?"</h2>
                <h1>Worship or Praise?</h1>

                    The book of Psalm 100:4 says that we should approach God and 
                    enter into His presence through Praise and gratitude. 
                    Praise might be considered an automatic reaction that gets 
                    our hearts ready for Worship. Praise can bring us to a 
                    position of humility and preparation for Worship because 
                    of its joyous and festive nature. Praise creates a 
                    foundation for more in-depth Worship by preparing our 
                    hearts and enabling us to express gratitude to God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The book of Matthew 21:9 depicts Jesus entering Jerusalem 
                    and receiving Praise from the people. Ephesians 5:19-20 
                    features the apostle Paul urging followers to sing praises 
                    to God. These books suggest that the purpose of Praise is 
                    to acknowledge the goodness of God and to prepare the way 
                    for more intense Worship. Praise frequently opens the door 
                    to worship.

                <h3>Most Christians...</h3>
                <p>
                    Most Christians believe it is a meaningful way to request 
                    God’s presence. They believe that it’s crucial to engage in 
                    both public and private Worship. God desires for you to come 
                    into His presence. According to Psalm 22:3, God resides or 
                    is enthroned in the praises of His followers. Biblical 
                    scholars believe that they develop our faith, strengthen 
                    our relationship with God, and conform us to His image. 
                    They contribute to developing a profound relationship 
                    between us and the Almighty. Praise enables us to 
                    demonstrate our appreciation and acknowledge God’s 
                    qualities, whereas Worship encourages us to give our 
                    hearts and live by His will.

                    The difference between worship and praise can be summarized 
                    as follows:
                </h3>   
                <p>   
                    <span>Focus:</span> 
                    Praise emphasizes what God has done, while worship 
                    emphasizes who God is.
                    <br>
                    <span>Expression:</span>
                    Praise is often a physical act of adoration, whereas worship 
                    occurs in the innermost being and involves a deeper 
                    connection.
                    <br>
                    <span>Intent:</span>
                    Praise is about God, while worship is directed to God, 
                    involving submission to His will and recognizing His 
                    sovereignty.
                    <br>
                    <span>Depth:</span>
                    Worship is considered a more intimate and profound 
                    expression of faith compared to praise, which can be more 
                    outwardly expressed.
                </p> 
                In essence, while both are forms of reverence, worship is a 
                deeper, more personal experience.
