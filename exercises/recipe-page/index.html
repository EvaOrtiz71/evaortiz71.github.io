        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

            <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup red curry paste</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>13-ounce can coconut milk</li>
            <li>1/3 cup water or broth</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar or palm sugar</li>
            <li>
                1/2 to 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or 1 finely chopped red 
                chili (to taste)
            </li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped Thai basil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cilantro, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped scallions, optional garnish</li>
            <li>chili oil, optional garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DUMPLINGS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil</li>
            <li>12 to 16 dumplings or wontons</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large pot over medium heat, melt the coconut 
                oil. Once it’s warm, add the ginger paste and 
                minced garlic. Sauté for a minute or two until 
                fragrant, but don’t let it brown.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
                Stir in the red curry paste and cook for about 2 
                minutes to bring out its full flavor.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
                Pour in the coconut milk, water, fish sauce, lime 
                I have one more juice, brown sugar, and red pepper 
                flakes. Stir until everything is well combined, then bring 
                it to a gentle simmer. Let it bubble for 5 to 7 minutes to 
                allow the flavors to come together.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
                Taste the broth first before adding any salt. Then season 
                as needed. Adjust with more lime juice, sugar, or red 
                pepper flakes depending on how tangy, sweet, or spicy you 
                like it.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
                While the soup simmers, heat neutral oil in a nonstick 
                pan over medium heat. Add the dumplings or wontons in a 
                single layer and cook until the bottoms are golden brown. 
                Add a splash of water, cover, and steam until fully 
                cooked through.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
                Turn off the heat and stir in the Thai basil and 
                cilantro.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
                Ladle the hot soup into bowls and top with the crispy 
                dumplings. Garnish with scallions or a drizzle of chili 
                oil if you like a kick.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Tips & Notes</h4>
        <p> 
            <b>
                Q: Can I use green or yellow curry paste instead of 
                red?<br>
            </b>
            A: Yes! Red curry is the boldest and spiciest of the three, 
            but if you prefer something milder or slightly sweeter, 
            yellow or green curry paste will still work beautifully in 
            this soup. Just know the flavor profile will shift a little — 
            still delicious though!
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: What kind of dumplings should I use?</b><br>
            A: Totally up to you! You can use any store-bought 
            frozen dumplings — chicken, veggie, or shrimp all 
            work great. If you're feeling extra, homemade 
            dumplings would take it to the next level, but 
            frozen ones make this super easy and fast.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: Do I need to thaw the dumplings first?</b><br>
            A: Nope! You can add them straight from the freezer into the 
            simmering broth. They’ll cook through in the soup and soak up 
            all that flavor.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: What if I want crispy dumplings?</b><br>
            A: You can absolutely pan-fry them first for a crispy 
            golden exterior, then gently place them into each bowl 
            when serving so they stay crunchy. Steaming them works 
            too if you want a softer texture without boiling them 
            in the broth.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: Is this soup spicy?</b><br>
            A: It has a nice warmth to it, but it’s not overwhelmingly 
            spicy — especially if you use just a spoonful or two of curry 
            paste. You can always tone it down with a little extra coconut 
            milk or bump it up with chili oil or sliced Thai chilis if you’re 
            heat-loving.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: Can I make this vegan or vegetarian?</b><br>
            A: Yes! Just use a vegetarian curry paste (some contain shrimp 
            paste), swap in veggie broth, and use plant-based dumplings. 
            For the fish sauce, you can substitute with soy sauce, tamari, 
            or even a dash of mushroom soy sauce for that deep umami flavor 
            without any seafood.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: How can I store leftovers?</b><br>
            A: If you’re making this ahead or saving leftovers, keep 
            the dumplings and broth separate so the dumplings don’t get 
            soggy. Reheat the broth on the stove, then add in the dumplings 
            just before serving.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: Can I freeze it?</b><br>
            A: The broth freezes really well! Just cool it completely 
            and store in an airtight container. Dumplings are best added 
            fresh or from frozen when reheating.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: What veggies go best in this soup?</b><br>
            A: Green beans and red bell peppers are perfect! They 
            hold up well in the broth and add color, texture, and 
            a little natural sweetness. Slice the bell peppers thin 
            so they cook quickly, and add the green beans just long 
            enough to get tender but still vibrant.
